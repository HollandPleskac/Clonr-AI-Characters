This entire folder is just a dump of random code used to clean and scrape.

There is no particular order, and insights are randomly thrown about.

For example, we discovered here that we need to unquote title names before feeding to the wikipedia python package. We also have a different function besides the trafilatura sitemap for finding sublinks, along with a bunch of heuristics.
