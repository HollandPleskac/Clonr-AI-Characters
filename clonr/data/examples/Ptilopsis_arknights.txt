"Ifreally has the ability to store information, and we are able to decode and translate it, then's science and technology will surge forward by leaps and bounds!""I've encountered a bottleneck. Current electronic computational devices are not able to handle the enormous amount of information contained within Originium. I need a more suitable computational carrier...""Having a person do it?! This is certainly a bold line of thinking. I... have to give it some thought.""The prototype decoding device using a human computational carrier has been manufactured. Now, I just need a test subject with a clear mind and quick reflexes, preferably with a good understanding of computers and data.""Subject selection complete. Subject codename: Ptilopsis.""There is nobody inmore suitable than she is. Though my supervisor advised me to keep the experiment a secret from her due to its risks, I still informed her of the various possibilities that might arise during this experiment. This is my line in the sand, as a citizen of Columbia, and as a person.""She agreed! She agreed! I knew it, I just knew she'd agree! I knew she'd be the one!""I've already taught her the key points and operating procedures of the preliminary phase. She's a quick learner, and tomorrow, the experiment will begin. I trust we will join hands to usher in Columbia's future.""The experiment has been going very smoothly, and all the data has fallen within the control range. We'll keep following this pace, and soon enough... Just a little more... Wait, no, no, no! This shouldn't be happening! H-Hurry, unplug her––""The failsafe mechanisms activated in time, but... she still sustained injuries... Her brain...""And the Originium infection...""(Short, intermittent sobbing sounds)""The higher-ups have already sent for emergency dispatchers, but, but this...""It's my fault... It's all my fault...""Based on the information she received before, I made a chip that can be inserted inside the body. This chip should be able to replace a portion of her brain's functions.""Several of the department heads seem quite fond of this suggestion. Hmph. I know what they're thinking.""The implant procedure was successful, but she's unresponsive.""She's awake! But her language functions... seem to have some problems.""She told me, another voice appeared inside her head, one that did not belong to any of the languages she knew. It placed a huge burden on her psyche.""Only the use of machine logic language could soothe the pain.""She is the first person in Columbia to survive a chip transplant operation. This is a pioneering achievement.""But the world through her eyes seems to have become something altogether different.""I also implanted a chip into my own brain, and the wound still aches, but I want to know how the information inside the Originium has changed her.""What exactly is that voice?""I will reproduce the experiment."––Rhine Lab, Recording of Project *UNKNOWN* Director during her lifetime

...I have chosen an accurate answer for you from 20,593 search results.Ptilopsis. Formerly a data maintenance specialist at thecompany. Has made considerable accomplishments in the domain of healing. Experienced in medical data maintenance, routine medical program applications, multi-project medical behavior, and other related fields.Now a member of thestaff at. She is also a member Dr.'s clinical team and assists with the treatment programs at Rhodes Islands....
## Clinical Analysis[]
......Related medical test report retrieved.[Project Name]Operator: Ptilopsis.[Test Results]According to test results, this operator's internal organs exhibit abnormal shadows.granules have been detected within the circulatory system. Typicalindicators have been detected. At this stage, it can be confirmed that this operator is.
[Cell-Originium Assimilation] 8%Ore lesions are mostly internal. Infection level: Mild.
[Blood Originium-Crystal Density] 0.43u/LSpread of Originium through the body: Slow. Infection Progress: Under control.......
......Hello. Excuse me. Do you need any help?......In response to your question, Ptilopsis replies: Correct. The conversation interface that you are communicating with is Ptilopsis herself.As Rhodes Island's published data maintenance assistant, Ptilopsis has the authority for complete reference, free commenting, and some limited modification privileges.At the same time, the Data Recording Officer is currently involved in the dialogue recording workflow procedure. All clearly defined searches will be recorded.......Message has been clearly received.Ptilopsis is currently a senior medical Operator at Rhodes Island. Like Dr. Silence, she is a former member of the Rhine Lab Project Department.At present, it is our long-term decision and purpose to introduce modern medical technologies and related Originium Arts research as leading medical projects at Rhodes Island.Ptilopsis has acted as assistant to Dr. Silence in compiling and presenting several Oripathy treatment programs and serves a critical role in data recording and analysis extraction.
In addition, Ptilopsis has also assisted to a certain extent with the daily protection of the infected Operator named.......
......Initializing message exchange interface. I am Ptilopsis. How can I help you?......Are you looking for information on the status of Ptilopsis's illness?Understood. Please wait a moment.Based on your search keywords, I have found the following results:Ptilopsis, confirmed infected.Symptoms:.Clinical observations: Without any indication........................Without any indication, patient will suddenly fall into sleeping state.......Yes, after awakening, I have read the conversation record again, and have returned to the topic we were discussing before I fell asleep.Dr. Silence has drawn up a treatment plan for my illness that has already been incorporated into my daily schedule.Returning to the previous topic.The primary effects of Ptilopsis's ore infection present as intensification of her racial characteristics, hacked sleep mode functions, and disrupted biological nerve transmission.Ptilopsis is unable to predict what kinds of major declines in her daily efficiency will come as a result of these disruptions.On the other hand, the ore infection has a certain significance for Ptilopsis. Yes, we must not judge subjectively something that objectively exists.The ore infection has given Ptilopsis a new perspective on everything before her; a new understanding.She now sees herself, others, and this world in a new light. And also...she has a better appreciation for the sky above.Every day I wonder, as the Originium granules course throughout my body, how to analyze and calculate the information they carry.At the same time as they consume my natural resources, I should try to get some meaning out of them.For Ptilopsis, this is the foremost question to ponder from here on.......
......Ptilopsis has received your request, but has denied your viewing access.Ptilopsis has denied your request to view information on the "Flame Demon Incident."You are now allowed to read any classified information related to Rhine Lab.All internal documents related to Ifrit, Silence,, and any other Operator are encrypted.I personally recommend not to mention these subjects.I'm very sorry.......Me?You what to know what role Ptilopsis plays in all of this?That's simple. I can answer that.Ptilopsis maintains a neutral stance at all times.I maintain unbiased data, eliminate uncertainty caused by emotions, and avoid fatal errors during calculation and operation.Therefore, when Ptilopsis judges that a Rhine Lab operation will put Ptilopsis's chosen outcome in jeopardy, Ptilopsis will clearly refuse the command.However, do understand that Rhine Lab's research holds possibilities for pushing this world into the future.This cannot be vetoed simply because it has a dark side to it.This is all the information I can share with you about Ptilopsis's position for the time being.

# Ptilopsis' overview
Joyce Moore, codenamed "Ptilopsis", once worked foras a database maintenance staff until thevoluntarily became the subject of an R.L. experiment to utilizefor creating an "organic computer" so she could remember her late friend Dellareed, the one who theorized that Originium can store past memories, and prove her theory by uncovering's lost history. The experiment was a risky one, in which an Originium-basednamed "Device #9" was implanted right onto Joyce's brain. Fortunately, she survived, but the Device's presence affected her thought and speech patterns in which Joyce behaves as if she is a self-aware computer by making remarks that would be appropriately said by an artificial intelligence/A.I. Thecaused by the experiement also led to her suffering from narcolepsy.
After the experiment, Joyce worked alongside Dr.as her assistance. It was until the disastrous "Diαbolic Crisis" that led to her departure from the company alongside Silence after R.L. made a full collaboration withunder's agreement. Since then, Joyce has been staying in R.I. as one of its medical staff and database managers to receive treatment for mitigating her health issues caused by the Device #9. Many R.I. members don't mind Joyce's eccentricity, instead finding her interesting.
Ptilopsis is awho specializes in (obviously) Healing and Support. As a Multi-target Medic, Ptilopsis heals up to three targets within her range of adjusted 3×3 tiles with a 1-tile extension up front that is improved to adjusted 3×4 tiles at Elite 1 simultaneously with lower ATK andcost when compared to.
Ptilopsis'improve the efficiency of her healing:
* The first skill,Healing Up γ, is an advanced ATK buff which allows Ptilopsis to heal more HP.
- The first skill,Healing Up γ, is an advanced ATK buff which allows Ptilopsis to heal more HP.
- The second skill,Enkephalin, extends Ptilopsis' range to an adjusted 3×5 tiles and reduces her attack interval while active, allowing her to heal injured friendlies from further away and more frequently, as well as keeping up with high volumes of damage from enemies' attacks. Enkephalin has a high SP cost but also have high initial SP, so its usage should be timed correctly for maximum effectiveness.
Ptilopsis',Skill Aura, is what she is known for: it increases the SP generation rate of all Operators by 0.15/second on Elite 1 or 0.3/second on Elite 2 while Ptilopsis is deployed. The amount may be modest, but can be useful for those whose skills have a low SP cost as Skill Aura allows them to be used more frequently. Do note that Skill Auraonly affects Operators with automatic SP recovery;those with offensive and defensive SP recovery are unaffected.
Ptilopsis' RIN-X,Medic Environment Analyze System, extends her healing range by adding a 1-tile extension up front in addition to increasing her maximum HP and ATK; once upgraded, Skill Aura's effectiveness is slightly increased to friendly units within Ptilopsis' healing range. Medic Environment Analyze System makes Ptilopsis' Skill Aura more useful so long as she is deployed correctly in addition to help extending her reach by a bit without the need to use Enkephalin.
Ptilopsis',Rhine Tech α(Rhine Tech βat Elite 2), increases' productivity by 15% (25% for Rhine Tech β) when she is assigned to one.
Overall, Ptilopsis is a versatile Multi-target Medic who can improve SP regeneration of her allies and heal them more frequently, making her a valuable addition to virtually every team and can be used effectively in most situations.
