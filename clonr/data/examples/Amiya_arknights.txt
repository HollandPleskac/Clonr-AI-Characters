First, there are a few indistinct silhouettes. Soon, a dazzling light. Gradually, the light grows distant and rises to the sky, leaving behind bright blotches. Not long after, these points of light themselves speed far away, and all that remains is a meaningless, jet black.You remember those blotches are celestial bodies, every one. You remember the home of the stars is called the cosmos.Then immediately, your sight abruptly grows clear. Sleek metal. A sealed room. A clear window forms your third eye–through the window, you gaze at a colossal grey sphere, and in the center of that megastructure no normal mind could comprehend, it quietly awaits its birth father...You suddenly feel a kind of movement. A fluid wets your vision. You begin to seek this emotion's root. You see a child's birth. It is your child. A brand new fate, a soul entrusted... But against that yawning megastructure, how insignificant a life of such miniscule proportions it is.You return to the now, and gaze at those engineering ships, big and small. You, the mathematician, quickly make a ridiculous comparison–even the smallest ship among them is thousands of times larger than an infant of mankind.But you have all done it. Starting from the antiquity of antiquity, starting with fire or a hunt, you have come all the way to today.You are immensely proud. By some mysterious mechanism, you feel this pride as if it is yours, upon which more information pours into your mind. You remember your own identity. You realize that you are the designer of that artificial satellite. And after such a long journey in, you finally greet the moment of its completion with your very own eyes.Honor, wealth, family, ideals... such vocabulary flickers elusive, hovers, dissipates, and in the end there is left one, and only one........."Future...""What? What did you see?""...""Hey, respond! Hey!"All present lapse into silence. A young woman to the side wells with urgency."Examine his brain! I told you we shouldn't have been so hasty! We only just set up protocol channels to database comms! This is only our first recorded successful transmission!""...I'm sorry.""Wait. What are you saying?""I mean... I never used to be too fond of you planetary engineers. I always felt your work was all style, no substance... but I saw it. I saw your past, I shared in your past. I felt your emotions. It was... like nothing else.""You...""Yes. I felt you reminisce, like an ordinary father, about your children and your home. I saw that artificial moon, astonishing as anything. And the sensation, it's beyond all imagination... We've done it."Once again, everyone is silent."So..." The one to break the silence is a fairly young, red-haired lady. "How will it record our epoch, and the epochs to come?""As an omnibus of idiocy, I assume," someone responds thoughtlessly. "We've had quite enough ourselves, but from here on out, none of them will ever find another excuse to embellish history.""Have a little more faith in mankind, friends," says another, elderly, who simply sits down and shuffles herself into a comfortable position. "We've drawn enough lessons already. Our progeny won't be repeating our blunders."Some chuckle bitterly. It is, of course, no more than a beautiful wish."...So we've definitely succeeded? Project DWDB-221E has borne fruit so quickly... My god."With no warning, a curly-haired person springs to his feet."Are we always going to call it DWDB-221E? I know, project numbering follows regulation format. Cold, cold nomenclature, just like with AMa... But our workdeservesa more dignified official name!" Once again, he throws out the proposal he hadn't relented on for more than half the year now. "I want to call it... 'Destiny'! Or maybe 'Truth of the World'?"The ensuing silence is now an awkward one."How about the 'Black Crown'? In terms of an intuitive visual impression of parts of its appearance, it does resemble a crown, after all.""Eh, not a fan. That one sounds like some boring historical drama.""In that case..."The elderly woman interrupts her subordinates before they embroil themselves in yet another endless dispute. She gazes out at the stars beyond the window. Some unwelcome information is arriving, but humanity will ultimately overcome this hardship, just as it has countless times before."I have a proposal...""We should call it–''."

According to the records, the saber wielded by theLord Kollam was between 0.9 and 1.2 meters long, about 5 centimeters thick, made of an unknown material, black in color, and bore a traditional Sarkaz inscription, which read "here the fighting stops".After succeeding to the throne, Kollam reorganizedand felt that time in the west had been unkind to the people, so he led some Sarkaz tribes to the east, at which point he vanished from history.According to legend, Kollam had the power to rout his enemies without fighting. Some accounts say that Kollam's enemies suffered a weight several times that of their normal weapons when facing him in battle, finding themselves physically and mentally defeated. If they were lucky enough to survive, they were often maimed. But some referred to Kollam as an enlightened despot, saying that cuts from his blade drew no blood, and anyone wise enough to retreat would survive.However, some ancient texts claim that Kollam's saber was destroyed in battle before he even succeeded to the throne, and that the weapon he later wielded was a fragile illusion born of his Arts. Such claims are inconsistent with Kollam's subsequent performance in Sarkaz conflicts, and few can explain why Kollam would not recast his favorite sword under those circumstances. I speculate that Kollam did have the power to shape weapons with Arts, and this theory is centered on the throne. But that Kollam rarely used his Arts in that way, having once been an adventurer.Of course, it is written that after Kollam's ascension, his saber gave off a greenish light, like a breath of flame. Kollam's famous ferocity led to the blade being dubbed "Wrathful Cerulean Flame".Most of the Sarkaz legends have been lost in the ongoing ruination of Kazdel, which has tremendously impeded historical research. There have been recent calls from Sarkaz scholars to restore their history, but their own research has been poisoned by propagandistic efforts to paint a noble picture of the Sarkaz race.

Amiya is awho specializes in DPS and is given as one of the startingand (for the purpose of giving out) one of the first clear rewards of,,,, and; she isneveravailable fromandotherwise. As a Core Caster, Amiya's attacks deal Arts damage to one target at a time with a moderate ATK and attack interval, and a range of 3×3 tiles with a 1-tile extension upfront at Elite 1, and has a decent DP cost. Unlike most other Operators, Amiya'scannot be improved with, making her potential tied to the player's progress in the.
What sets Amiya apart from other Core Casters is herwhich allows Amiya to inflict serious damage if used correctly:
* The first skill,Tactical Chant γ, is an advanced ASPD buff useful at situations where sustained DPS is needed. Unlike the other two skills, Tactical Chant γ is the only one with no drawbacks.
* The second skill,Spirit Burst, makes Amiya attack multiple random enemies in range with a barrage of multiple projectiles that deals a lesser portion of her ATK each while active, but she will befor a short time as soon as it expires. Since Spirit Burst isautomatically activated,players should exercise caution when using it; not only it might be wasted if there is no enemy around, but its drawback also leaves Amiya temporarily helpless.

Since Spirit Burst isautomatically activated,players should exercise caution when using it; not only it might be wasted if there is no enemy around, but its drawback also leaves Amiya temporarily helpless.
- The third skill,Chimera, is more extreme; while active, Amiya unleashes her/King powers whichgreatlybuffs her HP and ATK, extends her range to 3×4 tiles with 3-tile extensions on the sides, and makes her attacks do Pure damage, allowing her to defeatandwithout much trouble and survive attacks that would otherwise flatten her. As soon as Chimera expires however, the exhausted Amiya will be forcibly retreated (despite appearing as if she had been knocked out in-game), thus it is best used as a last-resort measure or if it would guarantee victory.
Amiya'sinitially has no effect at all, shown by question marks in its name and description. Once she isto Elite 2 however, it is revealed to beEmotional Absorptionwhich gives SP when she damages an enemy (notmerely attacking them, despite what is stated in-game) and more when she defeats an enemy. Players who want to be safe with Amiya by using Tactical Chant γ over Spirit Burst or Chimera will find Emotional Absorption useful, as they can keep Tactical Chant γ active for most of the operation with it; otherwise, Emotional Absorption can cover the very high SP costs of Spirit Burst and Chimera.
Amiya's CCR-Y,, gives her 1 SP when damaging elite and boss enemies with her attacks, in addition to increasing her maximum HP and ATK; once upgraded, the SP generated by Emotional Absorption is increased for each damage dealt from Stage 2 and when defeating enemies at Stage 3.
Amiya's first,Agreement, increases the order acquisition efficiency of allby 7% when she is assigned to the. Her second base skill,Violin Solo, increases the morale recovery rate of all Operators resting in a(including Amiya herself) by 0.15 per hour when Amiya is assigned to one.
As a word of caution, the playermustpromote Amiya to Elite 2 by the timeis accessible to progress further in the Main Theme, since the penultimate operation,,can only be started when an Elite 2 Amiya that is not ais present in the squad– this is no longer necessary once JT8-2 is cleared for the first time. Once this is done, Amiya'swill be available for use.
Overall, while Amiya can be a double-edged sword as Spirit Burst and Chimera allows her to cause massive damage but with crippling drawbacks, she is easily accessible and will remain useful even after additional 5★ andCasters had been obtained. Indeed, contrary to earlier gacha games featuring weak or lackluster protagonist characters, Amiya is considered to be one of the solid Core Casters.
