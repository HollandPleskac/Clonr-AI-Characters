### First Appearance
"Awww, that's so sweet. I think."
Marleneis a secondary female otter character who appears exclusively in the. She was likely created to give the TV series an important female character since all the penguins and lemurs (and most of the other animals ) are male.
Marlene lives in the. She is friendly with the penguins, but she is mostly neutral and does not take sides between the penguins and the lemurs. Marlene is usually the first one the penguins go to when a five-man team is needed. When a six-man team is needed, she andare usually called. Marlene visits theoften. Her level-headed attitude always seems to clash with's paranoia, yet that doesn't stop the two from being good friends.
## Life in the Aquarium[]
It's said that Marlene was transferred to thefrom an aquarium in northern California (which also had penguins, as stated in). In, Marlene reveals to the penguins and King Julien that she was born in captivity, and it's shown that if she leaves the zoo property, she goes feral. She won three trophies in a zoo contest, as revealed in "" before being kicked out of the competition due to some sort of 'scandal'.
Marlene is super smart, funny, level-headed, and acts as a voice of reason, but she can also be extremely sarcastic (which is usually taken byas her being serious). She's frequently irritated by Skipper's blatant sexism that women are weak and no good at anything aggressive. She believes that Skipper's far too paranoid. Sometimes, she's proven right and other times, she's proven wrong. On the other hand, sometimes, Marlene is the one who prompts the penguins to take action.
Whenever new animals arrive at the, she, like, humbly welcomes them, encouraging friendly behavior.
Despite Marlene usually being sensible, she dreams of having somebody play Spanish guitar music to her (in "," "," "," and "") and she can also be rather vain and attention-seeking of humans, as in "" and "," but they don't notice her. She can be a little bit gabby and can usually babble the unthinkable, and as a result, getting her mouth covered. As of that, she got her mouth covered by Skipper in "" when he sensed something and silenced her and in "" when Skipper quickly covered her mouth before she said anymore of the penguins' HQ. In "," she was shown to secretly want to be a pop sensation, that she performed imaginary concerts.
Marlene always becomes wild and feral as soon as she's outside the zoo walls (but she seems fine inside the sewers). However, on occasion, this has been forgotten.
She also seems to have a major love for candy, as evidenced in "" and "." She also craves popcorn, as shown in "."
When her pool had too much chlorine, she jumped in and came back up with her fur bleached. This left her friends to think that she was a rare arctic mink named Arlene. Her personality hadn't changed, but she was a little mad when no one listened to her.said that she's a gabby one (as explained above). Later, Marlene was brought to the vet and her fur was dyed back to its original color.
While Skipper and Marlene get on well most of the time, they are almost complete opposites in personalities. Skipper is highly paranoid, while Marlene is open and willing to look for the best in anybody. They also have a tendency to rub it in each other's faces when one of them is proven right, and neither is willing to compromise or back down during any disagreement. Skipper also doesn't hide the fact that he looks down on non-avians.
Kowalski and Marlene have a pretty good relationship. At one point, Kowalski valued her opinions to help get people back to the zoo to prevent it from being shut down completely.
Marlene and Private are good friends. In "Badger Pride", she helped Private get over his fear of badgers. However, this later backfires when Marlene inadvertently insulted the badger girls,and. Private later saves her from the two badgers and sends all three of them on the other side. However, Private never intended to hit Marlene.
Ironically, out of all four of the penguins, Marlene seems to have the most in common with Rico and they're shown to get along really well. They are also different in ways that would help them mesh, such as Rico's willingness to take orders. For example:
1. ~ She rode on Shelly and he used her as a boomerang - to which she admitted was rather fun.
1. ~ She was paired with him (and Phil) and they constructed half of the zoo's decorations.
1. ~ She found petting him strangely comforting.
1. ~ Marlene's able to convince Rico to give a relationship witha chance, which suggests that Rico has more trust in Marlene than Shelly, who he seems to find rather intimidating.
- ~ She rode on Shelly and he used her as a boomerang - to which she admitted was rather fun.
- ~ She was paired with him (and Phil) and they constructed half of the zoo's decorations.
- ~ She found petting him strangely comforting.
Marlene dated Fred for a brief time when Kowalski's latest invention suggested he was her one true love. However they didn't click and it was shown that the Love-U-Lator did work - but was pointing at Fred's roomie - a suave otter.
An otter originally from Northern California, Marlene is still adjusting to her new life in Manhattan. Fiercely independent, Marlene has decided not to choose sides between the Penguins and the Lemurs. In fact, she finds herself agreeing withas often as she agrees with. Marlene's playful spirit often clashes with Skipper's organization and discipline but that doesn't hurt their friendship.
