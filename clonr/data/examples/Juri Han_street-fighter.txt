This is a Korean name; the family name is "Han".
Han Juri(: 한주리,,Juri Han, ハン・ジュリ: 韓蛛俐), also known as theSadistic Thrill-seeker(サディスティックスリルシーカー,Sadisutikkusurirushīkā,: 가학적인 스릴 추구자), is a video game character from theseries, first appearing in. She is a brutalmartial artist who derives pleasure from inflicting pain on others.
Juri wears a purple(a form of Chinese bra-like top) on her chest supported with eight straps that meet on her back, forming a spider pattern. She wears long, baggy, off-white sweatpants and purple tights, and long, fingerless gloves. Her fingernails and toenails are painted bright pink. She has dark hair styled into two horns on top of her head, which appear to be fastened with pink ribbons. She wears Taekwondo foot wraps on her feet.
Her left eye was damaged long ago (explained below) and replaced with thewhich amplifies her abilities.
In, she is wearing a purple and pink collared catsuit with a spider-shaped pattern in the back, with a black high-neck sleeveless top underneath, black fingerless gloves with pink designs, the pants from her catsuit have black inlines with dark purple and pink. She also has a black eyepatch with a magenta pattern on her left eye. The outfit returns as Juri's secondary costume inStreet Fighter 6, however the black inner top is removed, making it better resemble her original artwork from Cammy's character story.
Her first alternate costume is a blue-green winter jacket, pink and white pants, black knee-high boots, and matching gloves. She doesn't wear her eye patch in this costume, as her story mode appearance in this outfit occurs before Bison ripped out the Feng Shui Engine. Her second costume is somewhat similar to her primary outfit inSuper Street Fighter IV, her dudou is white, her trousers are black with pink and white outlines and wears matching black taekwondo ankle wraps on her feet, her hair is down and her bangs are dyed pink.
In her playable appearance in,Juri's fringes are depicted as half-fringe during the official trailer but retaining her current hairstyle in the games. She also has pink highlights at the left side of her hair.
She now wears a combination between her main outfit and her casual alternate outfit inSuper Street Fighter IV, her dudou is purely black beneath her white sleeveless top with a pink trim and a single button to keep it attached. Her sweat pants and tights are now white and black with a pink and neon teal trim resembling the color scheme of her second alternate costume inStreet Fighter Vand pink footpads and black soles that reaches on her ankles. Juri also accessorizes with pink fingerless gloves and a pair of black spiked bracelets and a spike necklace and all of the spikes on her bracelet and necklace are neon teal. She also carries a light pink cellphone that resembles a cat during her performance on her default win animation.
As a child when her parents are alive prior to their deaths at Bison's hands and was proud of her accomplishments in Taekwondo by winning a trophy, Juri's dark hair was long with full-trimmed bangs in each sides and has tied in two small horns in each sides adorned with two pink hairclips. She wears a pink dress with a large petal-like sleeves and a purple ribbon choker on her neck.
Juri fights purely for the thrill of the battle; unlike, who seeks meaning, her drive is much more vengeful, selfish and ruthless, as she's extremely sadistic, liking to inflict pain on her foes, and she's also extremely hot-tempered, as she can easily lose her temper when she is struck back in retaliation or without warning. Juri loves combat to the point where she becomes irritated when it is denied to her like whenrefused to fight her seriously, Juri scathingly replied that "he could just die" if that was the case. She displays several traits of a femme fatale, as she makes provocative and suggestive remarks toward her enemies, as well seen in her; she is also very cunning, as she is not above leaving her partners to further her own agenda. At times, she appears to be brooding and depressed,claimed she felt a sense of "loneliness" from Juri implying all her wiles and cruelty is just a cover for how broken she is on the inside.
However, despite her vengeful and ruthless behavior, she still has some vague sense of honor; during her mission (in theOVA), she left a young boy alive despite many civilians being caught in the crossfire. Juri also appears to detest fighting children, and viewsto be a far more abhorrent type of ruthless, which somewhat contradicts her opinion on otherusers. According to her win quote againstinStreet Fighter V, she is against animal cruelty. Juri is also slightly hypocritical in many of her criticisms and insults of other fighters, demonstrating that she needs to mask her pain by deflecting her flaws onto others. She mocks the suffering ofandat the hands ofdespite having gone though similar pain and trauma in her own childhood. But then always returns to help them in their times of need. Juri also callsa "pervert" and shows open distaste towards him for it, despite her deriving sexual gratification from hurting and taunting others herself. This seems to provide enough evidence thatwas spot on in her observation about Juri's psyche.
InStreet Fighter 6during her arcade story and despite M. Bison's death at the hands of Ryu in the end ofA Shadow Falls. Juri still wanted to get vengeance against Bison as well as not getting used to the advice of moving on with her vengeance given to her by Chun-Li following their battle.
Juri may also have been the first openly bisexual character in Street Fighter lore. Her listed interests upon her release originally includedbefore being changed to only spicy food and spiders.Despite this, her flirtatious nature with both genders remains, amongst the female fighters, she has taken a particular interest in Cammy and Chun-Li, the latter of which she claims has a "schoolgirl crush" on her although it’s possible she is only mockingly flirting with people. This is supported by her usual tone whenever she makes flirtatious comments, making her sexual orientation unclear.
Super Street Fighter IV's development team was instructed to make a female Korean character in response to many Korean fans who wished forto add a Korean character inStreet Fighter- something already established byandin their respective fighting game franchises. According to Capcom senior staff member, the team had planned to include a Korean character since soon afterbecame popular in South Korea but the South Korean government had a strict limitation against the Japanese language and culture, preventing them from including such a character.However, other competitors' fighting games (released some time shortly afterStreet Fighter II), such as SNK'sand Namco's, have had Korean characters, so it is unclear if this excuse is accurate.
The designers toyed with many different ideas, totaling between 400 and 500 variations of the character's appearance; there were hundreds of concept designs for Juri, including an overweight version and one that used mixed martial arts. Design Director Kami said regarding Juri: "From the start, we felt like, 'let's make her an evil, sexy character'."
The creators decided to give Juri a strong, unusual personality to make her a character which people will either love or hate. Juri was designed to be a member of S.I.N. in order to associate her with theStreet Fighter IVcharacters; thus, the Feng Shui Engine was created to give her a strong connection with S.I.N. The creators thought about putting the engine in her abdomen (like Seth's), but as this looked unattractive, they ended up putting it in her eye.
An idea early in development was to have her in a tragic love story, caught up with the wrong people. However, once this was put to Yoshinori Ono, he responded: "No way, that's no good, she can't be a good girl. Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick."They also chose to make a spider Juri's trademark, explaining the spider-web design on her top and her nickname,Spider.Her behavior and personality are also typically likened to that of a female "spider", as many species are known in particular for eating their mates.
Taekwondo had not been used by any character in theStreet Fighterseries before, so they decided that it would be a great chance to make Juri a practitioner.Juri's outfit was designed specifically so that her silhouette would look like a traditional Taekwondo outfit, but they gave her bright colors and unique designs to differentiate her from the rest of the cast.
Juri can be interpreted as a "dark mirror image" of Chun-Li. Both had their parent(s) killed byand, subsequently, swore a vendetta against him. The main difference is that Chun-Li maintains a strong sense of justice even while seeking to punish the Dictator, whereas Juri is willing to hurt anybody and everybody who gets in the way of her quest for revenge. Notably, another character designed after Chun-Li in Capcom's works holds greater similarities to Juri, being that of the characterof, whose vendetta was more rooted in vengeance and retribution out of bereavement out of the death of both parents and whose character is themed with a butterfly motif.
## Character Relationships
Juri doesn't have that many friends because of her warlike and provocative character but she will help others for her own benefit.
Juri and Chun-Li have a strong rivalry. Chun-Li has tried to arrest Juri at least twice, including when Juri captures and brutalizes, despite originally expressing disdain at having to fight women.
Unlike Chun-Li's hatred for her and all criminals, Juri does not seem to hate Chun-Li as much as she does enjoy toying and mocking her, even mockingly suggesting at some point that Chun-Li has a "schoolgirl crush" on her.
During the events of Street Fighter 6, an aimless Juri seeks Chun-Li out when she finds out information about a potentialon the rise.  After they spar with one another Juri tries to depart and entice Chun-Li to continue fighting her for more information, seeing their rivalry as the only thing she has left.  Instead Chun-Li continues to show compassion towards her, still holding out hope for her and sympathizing with what she'd lost and what she became because of M. Bison.  Despite Juri saying that Chun-Li's lectures "put her to sleep", she's seen later reflecting on them and simultaneously being annoyed that her words seem to have finally gotten through to her after all this time.
InProject X Zone, Chun-Li sees that Juri still has some good in her. After that, Juri would accept the offer to join the other heroes to save the universe. Given this, Juri may be the only criminal that Chun-Li doesn't hold any true contempt for.
Juri and Cammy initially had a mutual contempt for each other. Cammy bore a grudge against Juri for what she did to her "sisters", the Dolls, while Juri claimed that Cammy was sinful because of what she did in the past, before she lost her memory.
But during the story mode inStreet Fighter V, Juri saved Cammy andfrom the police and earned the former's thanks, though Cammy still hadn't forgiven her and warned not to hurt her "sisters" ever again. Juri was much less hostile, even fighting off Vega for her and in the process saving her. Later she helped Cammy and the Dolls in the final battle against Shadaloo, once again, along with, helping save Cammy from Vega. She is shown during the ending standing triumphantly with Cammy and the rest of the Dolls. It is assumed she doesn't consider the dolls hostile anymore since the fall of Shadaloo and that given Juri's actions, Cammy no longer holds the contempt she once did for her.
Juri and Cammy, surviving together.
In Street Fighter 6 Juri speaks fondly of Cammy and the memories of her, seeming to think about her whenever she's in London. Calling the time they spent together "good times.". She talks about the time she spent in Brazil when she came across Cammy and Decapre and the events of Street Fighter V. Revealing that she brought them both back to London with both Shadaloo and Cops on their tail. Calling every step of the way "one crazy moment after the next, with the climax at sea.".
The "climax at sea" Juri refers to expands on the ending of Street Fighter V. Juri, Cammy and Decapre took a boat to get back to London safely, but in the midst of all the excitement they got caught in a storm, a storm so horrible that not even Juri'scould save them.  It's revealed that Decapre was asleep during this escapade so Juri and Cammy had to rely on each other to survive.  Juri talks about how Cammy knew her way around a boat and even then they almost met their demise. Despite that, Cammy and Juri found a way to make it through the experience alive and in hindsight, Juri wishes that Decapre wasn't napping during the ordeal as she thinks going through that nightmare together would have been, a blast.
Cammy and her are seen weathering storm together. As they're positioned back to back they are shown turning to and smiling at one another. The experience insinuated to have brought the two closer.  While it cannot be confirmed if they are now friends, after the events and aftermath of Street Fighter V, they are no longer enemies.
Juri and C. Viper causing mischief and mayhem together.
During the World Tour mode inStreet Fighter 6, Juri reveals to have had a very close relationship with C. Viper. Talking first about howand thehad given them many different gadgets and toys to play with. Upon going further into detail, Juri reveals that her and C. Viper formed a partnership that allowed them to run the same stunt on other organizations at the same time. They'd infiltrate separately and pretend to be against one another, but in reality have the same goals. What goals? According to Juri, "Money and destruction.".  Juri laughs as she thinks about her, saying she expects C. Viper to betray the C.I.A. too before long.  Despite thinking about this fondly, she tells the player that her and C. Viper are cut from a different cloth and she doesn't want the player trying to copy what her and C. Viper do.
C. Viper fighting by Juri's side.
She further describes the war that broke out between Shadaloo and S.I.N. after Seth betrayed M. Bison. As she recounts this story, C. Viper is seen fighting by Juri's side.  It is unknown what their current relationship is, but if it's remained unchanged they can definitely be seen as partners and/or allies with similar goals in mind.  Juri seems to enjoy talking about C. Viper, and all the mischief and mayhem they caused together and likely looks forward to the day they can do it again.
Juri hates M. Bison with a passion, aswas responsible for the murder of her parents and the loss of her left eye, and she constantly plots to destroy him. Conversely, M. Bison regards Juri as he does many of his usurping 'pawns', if not most of his foes in general: a minor nuisance at worst. In spite of this, Juri and Bison are shown about to engage in another fight in M. Bison's ending, after Juri threatens that Bison should be less worried about where her special eye came from, and more about what she is about to do to him with it.
Her contempt for Shadaloo and Bison would make her go as far as willingly work for theinunder Helen (a facade of Kolin) and Urien.
Juri met Rashid thanks to Helen bringing him andto the Illuminati meeting, Juri immediately challenged Rashid to a fight, but Rashid had no interest in fighting her. Disappointed, Juri stated if he didn't take her seriously she'd have to kill him but Helen stopped them before the situation became serious.
DuringStreet Fighter V, Kolin and Juri seem to have a somewhat professional relationship since they had a common enemy to take down, M. Bison as well as Shadaloo. Both of them are also willing to go to great, and often questionable, lengths to achieve their goals; with Kolin wanting to help her lordachieve a prophecy and Juri wanting to take down those who have harmed her in the past.
Juri sees Seth as a pawn in her attempt to get revenge for the murder of her parents, despite the perverse joy she displays in working for him and brutally dealing with the enemies of S.I.N. Seth is well aware of this as shown in his ending, and in the end, Juri makes good of the threat. However, in Street Fighter V, Juri inadvertently resurrects Seth in a new feminine-like body, despite having no intentions to do so originally.
As seen inA Shadow Falls, Juri sees Vega as a "pervert" due to his obsession with beauty, though this is quite hypocritical given her own interactions with other male fighters. Vega on the other hand appears to feel genuinely attracted to Juri's beauty and psychopathic tendencies, calling her the "personification of evil beauty itself" in hisSSFIVwin quote against her, though he dislikes her provocations, saying that she lacks "delicacy".
A young Juri and her parents.
At the age of 15, Juri was the preeminent practitioner of Tae Kwon Do. Her father was a lawyer in charge of prosecuting organized crime operations. Juri describes her father as wielding "justice like a blade, slaying evildoers left and right". The whole country respected him. Juri included. She did as he told her and polished her Taekwondo skills as a result.  Juri was also a perfect student, both on paper and in the dojang. She won tournaments and they called her the "Beautiful Genius." However, when her father started targeting, her family was kidnapped by the organization. During the ordeal, Juri lost her parents and her left eye was gravely wounded.
Ten years later, she undergoes an operation at the S.I.N. laboratory to have theimplanted into that eye. The people operating on her note her calmness during the implanting. Juri assassinates operatives in a public area as her first mission in order to test out the Feng Shui Engine. Even with guns, her enemies stand no chance against her, taking them out one by one from behind.was called to the scene to stop the massacre. Chun-Li rushes into the scene to arrest Juri, and arrives just as Juri killed the gunmen using her Feng Shui Engine from the inside of a building. A woman dies in the attack from collateral damage. Juri and Chun-Li battle, ending with Juri unleashing her eye's power and knocking out Chun-Li. As her victim lays on the ground, Juri prepares to deal the finishing blow. However, her Feng Shui Engine malfunctions, forcing her to flee back to the lab.
After getting it fixed,assigns Juri her next mission: capturingelite female assassins, the. Juri flies to the base of the Dolls with several S.I.N. employees. She manages to defeat every single assassin in combat, includingand. As she carries the two unconscious assassins away to an S.I.N. plane, Cammy and Guile arrive.
They have a heated fight, but Juri comes out on top and manages to incapacitate Guile. She boards her plane and straps Juni and Juli to beds with wheels. As it takes off, Cammy manages to jump and grab onto the open boarding ramp, and confronts Juri for one final time. After an intense conflict, Juri pushes one of the rolling tables (with Juni on it) which collides with Cammy, who both fall off the boarding ramp into mid-air. They survive the fall, with snow breaking their fall.
Juri flies off and is congratulated by Seth upon returning. She licks her lips in anticipation, sensing that S.I.N and Shadaloo will clash in the very near future.

# "I just wanted to pit you two idiots together while I took over."
# —Juri Han, referring to Seth and Bison
During the global tournament hosted by Seth, he sends Juri in to participate; she sees it as a perfect opportunity for some 'fun.' During the tournament, Juri is confronted by Cammy and Chun-Li again; the results of the fights are unknown. Juri continues to tend to her hidden agenda.
In her ending, she approaches Seth, who was incapacitated as a result of Bison's brutal beating, and taunts him for "being nothing more than Bison's spare body." Before she is to dispose of him, she reveals that she was to serve S.I.N. for as long as it suited her purposes, since she was merely trying to pit Seth and Bison against each other - a task Seth obviously was not up to. Juri viciously crushes Seth'sby stomping on it, and leaves him for dead.
On October 2015, a datamining ofStreet Fighter V's PC beta test revealed fighter data and character meshes of Juri,,,,,and.Juri and the rest of the characters (except for Dhalsim who was confirmed earlier as a default fighter) were later confirmed on December 5th, 2015 at the PlayStation Experience.
Shortly after the fall of S.I.N., Juri faces off against Bison again to avenge her family. However, Bison quickly gets behind her, attacks her with Psycho Power and grabs her head. He rips out her Feng Shui Engine and leaves her for dead. She goes into an abandoned S.I.N. laboratory and finds another eye, the Feng Shui Engine Alpha. Juri meets up with Kolin (under the disguise as Helen). Kolin offers Juri the ability to join her, when they are interrupted by Balrog, who's looking around for S.I.N. agents. Wanting to test out her new eye, Juri fights him, before Ed tells him that they have to get back to base to discuss a plan. Juri later meets C. Viper, who informs her that the only reason she's not in jail is because she is not the primary threat and warns her about Shadaloo's motives.
Later at the Shadaloo base, looking around for data on Shadaloo, Juri confronts F.A.N.G., who becomes insulted by her remarks on being Bison's second in command. Their fight ends with F.A.N.G using his poison clouds to make Juri retreat. Juri now realizing their motives, calls Kolin by phone and finally accepts her offer to take down Shadaloo.
Whenandmeetand, Juri arrives by kicking open the door. She eyes the other people in her team and decides to fight Rashid, which he is reluctant about. Juri overwhelms him and he tells her to stop fighting. Juri threatens to kill him if he won't fight her seriously, at which point Azam steps in to defend Rashid. Helen breaks up the conflict and explains the danger of the Black Moons and presents a plan to stop Shadaloo. Juri shows interest in the plan and joins.
Juri after knocking a door open.
In Brazil, When Cammy defends Decapre by assaultingofficers, Juri arrives by motorbike and rams an officer. She picks up Cammy and Decapre, finding the situation amusing.Juri later watches with amusement as Cammy and Decapre (who is under the influence of the Psycho Power) fight before Cammy knocks Decapre out. When Vega arrives and defeats Cammy, Juri intervenes, calling Vega a pervert and mocks him. She fights him off and Vega decides to leave temporarily. She brings Cammy back to Russia with her team as they plan their final attack on Shadaloo.
During the final assault on Shadaloo, Juri and Decapre arrive to take on Shadaloo's soldiers. Decapre saves Cammy from Vega's claw. They team up to fight the other Dolls, who are still under the influence of the Psycho Power, who are controlled by F.A.N.G.
#### Other character story appearances
Juri appears at the end of Cammy's character story. She is shown to be listening in on a conversation between Cammy and, as Cammy swears to free the other dolls no matter the cost. Juri then comments on how "things are getting interesting".
In Guile's character story, Juri is spotted by Guile and Abel at the abandoned S.I.N. Laboratory, taunting them and stating that they should see what Shadaloo is up to before leaving.
In Abigail's character story, as he is constantly screaming about himself feeling "flat", Juri hears him and accuses him of calling her flat, believing that he "insulted her curves", and threatens to make him flat. Ultimately, Juri loses the fight and Abigail said that she got "wrecked".
In Seth's character story, she recovers the salvaged brain of former S.I.N. leader Seth, and places his brain in the latest model known as "Doll Unit Zero". Despite the warning, she boots the system immediately.
This sadistic thrillseeker enjoys the strife and suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes. Without revenge against M. Bison as a motivator, she whiles away her time in a gloomy haze.

##### Juri: Occupational Burnout
Juri thinking about how her quest for revenge had consumed her.
Juri reminisces with her hatred foras well as the fall of.  Thinking about all the things she did in order to eventually exact her revenge and being willing to do anything to accomplish her goal. After the apparent death of Bison and the fall of Shadaloo she doesn't seem to be satisfied. Instead she found herself angry, likely due to the fact she didn't deliver the death blow herself. Her inability to be happy at the completion of her goal frustrates her so she sets out to find more information.
"You too, are one of Bison's victims."
From Chun-Li's perspective it's revealed that she instead talked with Juri and wondering why she still is in pursuit of wicked and chaotic things.  Explaining that with Bison gone she doesn't understand why Juri hasn't found peace.  Juri asks her instead why she retired after Bison's death, insinuating she was a hypocrite for only being an agent till her own conquest was completed.  Chun-Li retorts that if revenge was all Juri cared about she wouldn't continue down a path of wickedness, insinuating Juri is searching for something she can't find. She asks her to atone for the bad things she's done in the past and still holds out hope for her, telling her "In a way... you too, are one of Bison's victims." just like her.  Juri laughs this off like she usually does, telling Chun-Li she'll have to "lecture her harder" if she wants to get through to her.
Juri thinking about Chun-Li and her words.
However later on Juri is seen sitting on her motorcycle thinking about Chun-Li's words. Chun-Li's sympathy and support in calling her "one of Bison's victims too" seemed to finally start reaching her.  Juri scoffs at these feelings, whispering to herself that she hates Chun-Li so much, for finally starting to get through to her.
Juri happy that Chun-Li hasn't lost her touch.
##### Chun-Li: An Agent's Day Off
After gathering some intel she seeks outDespite hearing that she had retired, Juri refused to believe that she wouldn't be intrigued by whatever information she'd found. Initially Chun-Li is apprehensive about Juri's intentions, particularly as Juri decided to introduce herself by challenging Chun-Li to a fight first.  Fighting Chun-Li seems to restore a slither of happiness in Juri, whom was worried Chun-Li had "lost her touch.".  Chun-Li thanked her for her concern before asking if a fight session was all she came for,  Juri informs Chun-Li that she came to warn her instead.  She'd found out some things that reinforced a belief that despite what they did during the events of Street Fighter V, there is more coming.  When Chun-Li asks her to elaborate, Juri insinuates that she wants Chun-Li to beat it out of her if she wants to find it out, insinuating that Chun-Li herself and their no longer volatile rivalry is all Juri has left to be happy about these days.

Juri makes a cameo appearance in the comic crossoverStreet Fighter VS. Darkstalkers.
Juri (along with M. Bison,,,,and) appear in Cygames'Shadowverseas one of the Leaders for the classes.
Juri fights usingand like most practitioners of the Korean martial art in fighting games (e.g.from/andfrom), Juri is an offensive-oriented, general rushdown character whose moveset mostly focuses on various kicks; she is a very flashy fighter who likes to toy with her opponent, and is used best in bursts of aggression or playing footsies.
Juri "roughs up" many traditional Tae Kwon Do moves by putting her own sadistic spin on them, as well as throwing in a few of her own moves. She is designed to be a hectic character with fast attacks that keep her opponents off guard; as such, she is weak defensively, and many of her moves can leave her open if blocked. She was created to be a very hard character to learn, yet very rewarding once fully mastered.
Juri hasthat she can choose to charge in a method similar to'sor's. If she chooses to charge it, she does a high kick that leaves a trail of energy which will hit very close opponents or cancel out approaching projectiles if timed correctly. Juri can then unleash her fireball/projectile at any time after that by releasing the button, either immediately or much later in the match. She also possessesthat moves at several ranges depending on the kick button pressed, and can be followed up with more kicks, unlike most dive kicks.
Her most notable technique is her, which moves her forward as she does a wheel kick similar to'sand's. Juri also hasknown as, in which she taunts her enemy into hitting her, and if the opponent strikes, Juri will either move backwards, jump into the air (and optionally react with an air attack), or dart behind her opponent..
Juri's,, has her unleash a flurry of fireballs that juggles the opponent, ending with a fireball that hits the opponent in the air diagonally. Her firstisFeng Shui Engine, which is a time-based move that allows her to chain together combos with her normal moves that ordinarily wouldn't combo together via the power of Juri's eponymous eye. Her second Ultra Combo is(chosen more often due to its easier use and direct damage), where Juri kicks the opponent, follows up with a multi-hit helicopter kick, and then kicks her opponent to the ground. Using the Feng Shui Engine's power, she gets to the ground before they land, "catches" them with one last kick, and then slams her opponent to the ground.
InStreet Fighter V, Juri maintains her moves. Her V-Trigger is the Feng Shui Engine (alpha); she chains her combos to her opponent. Her Critical Art is the; Juri unleashes a devastating heel drop to inflict multiple hits on her opponent.
InStreet Fighter 6, Juri's moveset has been further modified, combining aspects of bothIVandV's incarnations. She now has her Fuhajin store and Fuharenkyaku kicks as separate moves, and can store up to three Fuha stocks to amplify any of her kicks and chain them together. Each Fuharenkyaku now also has its own EX variant.returns to her moveset, but in exchange for's removal. Juri's Level 1 Super Art is a combination of Fuharenjin ending with Sakkai Fuhazan, her Level 2 Super Art is the Feng Shui Engine functioning much like before, and her Level 3 Super Art is the Kaisen Dankairaku, now performed with an initial side kick before initiating the rest of the animation.
* Juri's seductive behavior as well as her association with spiders is most likely based on the Japanesemyth of a demonic female spider who seduces her victims into holding a spider egg for her before she devours them. Said association could also be a nod to the Western belief of spiders being manipulators who deceive and trap others.Additionally, her name written in Hanja contains the Chinese character for spider (蛛).
* In the 2023 Women's Royal Rumble, WWE superstarcosplayed as Juri in her playable appearance inStreet Fighter 6but with her dyed blond hair.
* The younger Juri seen in her World Tour bears a near resemblance to Korean singer and rapper, Moon Sua from a K-Pop girl group, BILLLIE and the younger sister to the late singer and actor, Moonbin, a former member from a K-Pop boy group, ASTRO.
* Juri's Game Over cutscene inStreet Fighter 6actually breaks theby implying that Juri is aware that the player is watching her the whole time. The animation depicts exhausted Juri with camera panning out before Juri points at the camera (i.e player) and angrily yells"The hell are you looking at!?"at them.
