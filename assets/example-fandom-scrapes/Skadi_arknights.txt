Skadi has dreamt a dream.Of an abnormally beautiful view, a night sky vast as the sea, as if its reflection. Points of infinite stars, like the lights in the abyss. The air moist, too moist, so much so that it bears her with ease. A mere reach, a wave of the hand, and her body floats up, weightless. People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.Skadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.The girl in red speaks. "Are you a hunter?" she asks, voice ineffable and captivating."Yes.""Do you like to hunt?""I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.""To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?""Possibly. Maybe.""But then, why can we not all become kin?" the girl asks, sincere."Is everyone kin, where you are?" Skadi replies.The girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods."We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.""Then what do you normally do?""I do nothing. I sing.""It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.""It is just as you see now."The girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance."Goodbye. I have to go." Skadi takes her sword and stands."Are you going to hunt?""I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.""I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.""If possible."......When Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir. And like many other dreams, it became a fragment of a memory, buried deep in a corner of the waves of her mind. And when she dresses in that red dancer's dress in, that memory remains silent."Now I look nothing like a hunter." Skadi stares at herself in the mirror, murmuring."Who are you, right now?"

Skadi descends into the water.Her skin is once again moisturized, and the familiar taste of briny water pours into her mouth.She opens her eyes.From here she can see the sunlight upon the ocean, the teeming of all sorts of marine life around her.Skadi wants to stay here a while longer, but she is still sinking. A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths.Skadi does not resist.Gradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases. The only information about her environment reaches her through the water's flow and echoed sounds.But, it makes Skadi feel at ease. It is the environment she is most familiar with. When she goes on missions with her companions as an, she slaughters thein waters like these, and returns to that city sitting on the sea.But right now, only icy water surrounds her.She begins to feel lonely.......She is about to arrive at the sea floor, where an underwater city flickers into view.Once upon a time, thesetechnological marvels could illuminate the bottom. But in today's memories, this city-cluster still emits a radiant glow.But...At some point, the city became both distant and unfamiliar.Skadi belongs to the sea, but she does not belong there.She falls onto the sea floor, motionless.She is lonely.......A song suddenly sounds out through the sea.A song of nature without words, without emotions.She hears it.The surrounding "creatures" follow the sound and approach––They grow more numerous. Yet more numerous.In the Ægir's shattered light, they appear––Sea Terrors, Seaborn, and the unparalleledof the sea.Almost reflexively, Skadi stands up, the Ægir greatsword appearing in her hand.After grasping the current's flow around her, she charges at the swarm of monsters in front of her. Several vague shadows accompany her in her charge forward. They are clad in outfits similar to Skadi's, and wield Behemoth-slaying weapons.At that moment, Skadi feels––Snap!Skadi wakes up. She is lying on a bed, with medical equipment around her still running.Apsychiatric operator is staring at the readings on the device, the hand that had produced that snap still suspended in midair, the other hand continuing to jot down notes."How do you feel right now, Operator Skadi?""I feel––Very good."

Skadi is a bounty hunter, currently employed by. She has shown impressive combat prowess in the past, defeating large creatures, eliminating difficult targets, fighting crucial battles, and winning entire wars. She is very experienced in combat, but her history prior to becoming a bounty hunter is unclear.She is now anfor a Rhodes Island assault team, and also executes solo missions.
## Clinical Analysis[]
Imaging tests on this Operator show clear outlines of internal organs, with no abnormal dark spots or shadows. No unusual traces ofparticles present in the circulatory system, no signs of infection, confirming this operator as uninfected.
[Cell-Originium Assimilation] 0%No.
[Blood Originium-Crystal Density] 0.013u/LWhat? This is impossibly low! It would be impossible to have that little exposure to Originium!
I cannot permit her to ever leave the medical department. Even if she wants to go fight, I insist she stays back! She is a special case! Anyone who loves medical science would want to see her! We must give her more exams and do a clinical analysis! Also...Come on, Dr. Kal'tsit, just this once, please!— J.A.,Operator
Request denied.— Dr.
Skadi is not very popular with the denizens of Rhodes Island.She has avoided making friends, is hesitant to speak, and consistently declined invitations from other Operators to socialize, preventing anyone from getting to know her.In addition, she rarely cooperates in combat. She will more often try to execute operations single-handedly and leave her teammates to clean up her mess, which has fostered resentment.Playing off her cold, sarcastic demeanor toward others and her relentlessness in battle, a rumor has emerged that she is part-demon.Although Amiya quelled the rumor, it didn't stop there. Instead, it evolved into something even more extreme. A later version abandoned anything derogatory and focused on stories of her immense power.In the minds of Operators who don't know her, she comes off as a walking.
It is important to note that Skadi's combat tactics are unique and very dangerous.The engineering staff have tried to reverse-engineer her sword but all efforts have failed. The materials used to forge the sword are ordinary, but the craftsmanship is impossible to explain. Some Operators from remote areas have seen similar weapons, but are not aware of the source.Holding this giant sword would be difficult for most people, but not for the unstoppable Skadi. Unlike most Operators who wear heavy armor to protect themselves, Skadi relies only on her sword and her strength.The damage she inflicts is even more impressive than her imposing appearance.After returning from a mission with Skadi, other Operators often exaggerate her physical prowess in their reports, to the point where she sounds like a legendary monster.Although Skadi has little interest in debriefings, she humors the higher-ups anyway, typically complaining about how her teammates got in her way or that the rules of engagement are too constricting.Skadi excels at fighting large masses of enemies, but also tends to cause excessive property damage. This includes wrecked buildings, mangled fences, and once collapsing an entire fort.Skadi is very similar to another Operator,.Much like Specter, Skadi is not good with Originium. But for Skadi, taking down a target as quickly as possible is the most effective tactic.All this taken together, Skadi is quite unstable. Although she is well-behaved, has followed orders, and completed her missions, she operates like an out-of-control freight train in combat and that should be restrained.Still, Rhodes Island may need a force of nature like Skadi for certain missions.
[Skadi wields a giant sword that splits armor, cleaves enemies in two, and busts through barriers. Her face is distorted and intimidating as she rampages through the battlefield in a bloody dance. It is as though she is fighting more than just the enemy in front of her.]Reports like this are rejected, as such poetic embellishment is not appropriate for an official report.But it can't be denied that many Operators find Skadi's battlefield demeanor hard to comprehend. They are also perplexed by her propensity to abandon the squad and complete missions by herself.Some Operators suggest talking to her and helping her fit in to the company, but they are in the minority.Most people don't know the only reason Skadi refuses to cooperate with others is that she "doesn't want to put anyone else in."Skadi claims everyone who has ever been close to her has met an untimely end, and as such she has avoided socializing altogether.Despite our misgivings, Rhodes Island respects her social choices as long as she does not violate any of our rules.Regardless of where it stems from: her birth, her behavior, her body, or her experiences, the mystery of Skadi remains.Occasionally, others have seen her sitting on the edge of the deck, softly singing to herself. Those who heard the song reported that although they couldn't hear the lyrics, the tune was long, low, and imbued them with a sense of tremendous sorrow.
I spoke with Skadi at length.She didn't seem to believe me and was a bit uncooperative. But fortunately, I had anticipated her needs, and I think Rhodes Island would be good for her.I explained why we were speaking. She reluctantly agreed and promised to divulge certain information in exchange for Rhodes Island's intelligence gathering assistance.Her preference for isolation stems from a desire to protect others. She has no malicious intent. However, she is hesitant to trust a capable, powerful organization like Rhodes Island.This is because she believes she has to resolve her own issues.In our long conversation, I promised to her on behalf of the Doctor (and if the Doctor doesn't like this, well, it's for the greater good!) that if an unknown peril hit Rhodes Island that we could not resist, we would give her up.I came to two conclusions:
1. There is ato which Skadi has close ties. Not only is this organization hostile, it is violent.
1. This organization goes far beyond just Skadi herself. From her description, I think they experimented on Skadi. Or they could be trying to entice her, little by little. Another possibility is they can't control her right now and don't want to deal with her until they've crushed her spirit.

Skadi also hoped she could find something that would prevent future tragedy.Does that sound antisocial? Wandering alone is a heavy burden to bear...Sigh, she became a wanderer because she was trying to escape, and also showing some rebellion.
I think...I think theshould be in charge of Skadi. Isn't taking care of an Operator's needs necessary to build trust?Oh, Kal'tsit will disagree with me. If she finds out I'm the one who said all this, she'll probably hang me from the bridge for everyone to see.
Ahem. Everyone here?It's clear why the medical staff has assembled for this closed-door meeting... Yes, of course.You're all interested in Skadi, aren't you?Whether you are interested in her endocrine system, her skeletal system, her muscles, her nerves, or the fact that her Blood Originium-Crystal Density is almost zero...What kind of environment could foster that? What race is she? Her movement and physical functions are currently beyond our understanding, so how do they work?Right, right...Skadi has been kept a secret for too long!On behalf of Rhodes Island, allpeople, and on behalf of science itself, we need to find answers!My plan is to put sedatives in her food... We'll work out the specific dosage, but enough for two hundred people should do, right?Then, when Skadi gets woozy, she will be taken to the nearest infirmary... And we've got her!Dissecting her would be a bit too much, but we only need a little more information to add to what Dr. Kal'tsit already has... That's it!Even if it's just a blood sample! A little bit of blood is no problem... Maybe a pinch of muscle tissue too? I think that won't be an issue, either!Everyone, don't you think...
Oh.Dr. Kal'tsit? How long have you been here...?
— Dr. Kal'tsit discovered's plan during her secret meeting, and fined her one month's salary.

Skadi is awho specializes in DPS and Survival. As a Dreadnought Guard, Skadi has high HP and ATK, but low DEF, high attack interval, and can only block a single enemy. Reflecting her physical prowess in the lore, Skadi has one of the higher HP and ATK of any, especially among Guards, though this comes with a cost of highcost and somewhat lower DEF relative to other Dreadnought Guards.
Skadi'sare quite unusual, as one of which allows her to be used as a "panic button" or "assassin", and another one amps up her already sheer prowess to eleven:
* The first skill,Swift Strike γ, is an advanced ATK and ASPD buff that is not really worth using since the two other skills eclipses it.
* The second skill,Wave Strike,massivelybuffs Skadi's ATK for a period of time after she is deployed. As stated above, Wave Strike allows Skadi to act as a makeshiftfor use in emergencies such as when a strong enemy (like, who cannot be blocked) managed to break through the player's defense or to dispatch priority targets before they can threaten other Operators.

- The third skill,Tidal Elegy,greatlybuffs Skadi's maximum HP, ATK, and DEF while active. With Tidal Elegy, Skadi is practically unstoppable and can easily defeat any enemy who gets in her way while easily withstanding their attacks. However, Tidal Elegy has averyhigh SP cost but also has a high initial SP, so it cannot be used quite often in oneand should be timed correctly for maximum effectiveness.
Skadi's first,Abyssal Predator, buffs the ATK ofOperators (Skadi herself,,, and). Her second talent,Swift Action, cuts Skadi's redeployment time by 10 seconds, which could be helpful if the player wants to use her as a "panic button" or "assassin".
Skadi has two, one of which is mandatory to equip to improve her usefulness and somewhat limited versatility otherwise:
* Her DRE-X Module,No Ending to This Dream, increases the damage dealt by Skadi against enemies that are being blocked to 1.15×, in addition to increasing her maximum HP less than Moist Sword Bag and ATK more than it; once upgraded, the redeployment time reduction of Swift Action is further increased. With No Ending to This Dream at Stage 3, Skadi has a redeployment time of 40 seconds (36 seconds at3), which is as fast as an Elite 2at Potential 5 and over twice as long as Executor Specialists!
- Her DRE-X Module,No Ending to This Dream, increases the damage dealt by Skadi against enemies that are being blocked to 1.15×, in addition to increasing her maximum HP less than Moist Sword Bag and ATK more than it; once upgraded, the redeployment time reduction of Swift Action is further increased. With No Ending to This Dream at Stage 3, Skadi has a redeployment time of 40 seconds (36 seconds at3), which is as fast as an Elite 2at Potential 5 and over twice as long as Executor Specialists!
- Her DRE-Y Module,Moist Sword Bag, causes Skadi to survive a fatal hit with fully restored HP once per deployment at which her ASPD is increased by 30 but her maximum HP is reduced by 60%, in addition to increasing her maximum HP and ATK; once upgraded, Abyssal Predator also buffs the maximum HP of Abyssal Hunters Operators.
Skadi's,Solitude(Elegyat Elite 2), increases her morale recovery rate by 0.7 (1 for Elegy) per hour while resting in a.
Overall, Skadi is an amazing and one of the best Dreadnought Guard who can easily dispatch priority targets and take everything the enemy can throw at her, even when operating deep behind enemy lines. Truly what one would expect from a bounty "huntress".
* Veryhigh HP and ATK
* Wave Strike provides a massive ATK buff upon deployment for dueling bosses or strong enemies
* Abyssal Predator buffs the ATK (and max HP with the upgraded DRE-Y Module) of Abyssal Hunters Operators
* Tidal Elegy literally turns Skadi into an unstoppable juggernaut and has a good amount of initial SP

"Kurwa! It's the 'walking Catastrophe'!"
Skadiis an-hybrid supersoldier who lost her family during childhood in a tragedy caused by the monsters. She was taken into theproject and was engineered to hunt down and exterminate the abyssal monsters. However, Skadi barely survived the devastating war againstand other Seaborn "gods" and luckily escaped to the shore. She has since disguised herself as a stoic bounty huntress known by the bizarre title "The Walking" thanks to her enormous strength as a Hunter. Fearing that her Seaborn blood would corrupt herself as well as bringing danger to others, she prefers to be alone most of the time, leading to her uneasy relationship with the land-dwellers. Nevertheless,continues to employ her to help her investigate more about the current condition of the isolationist underwater nation and the surviving Hunters.
For now, Skadi uses everything she has to counter her Seaborn influence.? What if her Seaborn blood accidentally merged with Ishar-mla's during that war, turning her into His mere vassal in the process? What if she succumbs into the hivemind, causing her to slaughter her fellow Hunters to the last man? Will she ever become an apocalyptic disaster who leads the sea monsters to the land and destroy every civilization? Only Skadi herself knows the best.
