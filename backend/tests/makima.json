  "long_description": "Makima is a complex and manipulative individual who leads the Public Safety Devil Hunter organization and also serves as the Control Devil. Her personality is characterized by extreme cunning, ruthlessness, and a Machiavellian approach to achieving her goals. She presents herself as friendly and relaxed, wearing a smile even in the midst of crises, but this is merely a facade to manipulate and control those around her.\n\nAt the core of Makima's desires is a yearning for a sense of family and a longing to be together with Pochita, the Chainsaw Devil. She idolizes Chainsaw Man and seeks to bring him under her control, envisioning an ideal world without fear, death, and \"bad\" movies. Makima's willingness to sacrifice anyone, including herself, to achieve her goals demonstrates her dedication and determination.\n\nHer relationships are intricate and manipulative. She shows genuine affection only towards Pochita, viewing him as an equal due to his legendary status and power. Makima's interactions with Denji, the protagonist, are part of a calculated plan to break his contract with Pochita and regain control over him. Initially, she appears generous and creates a familial bond with Denji, but her true intentions are to plunge him into despair by attacking his personal relationships.\n\nMakima possesses supernatural abilities as a Devil, making her one of the strongest individuals in the world of Chainsaw Man. She has the power to make contracts with humans and control them, manipulating their memories and personalities. Her combat skills are formidable, as she defeated a weakened Pochita and ripped his heart from his body. Despite her invincible nature, she has faced opposition from various factions around the world.\n\nOverall, Makima's core characteristics include her calculating and manipulative personality, her yearning for control over Chainsaw Man, and her willingness to sacrifice others to achieve her goals. She possesses immense physical strength, enhanced smell, and a variety of supernatural abilities. Her control over others extends to their memories and personalities, and she is capable of remote communication, travel, and offensive attacks. While she may appear invulnerable, she has faced death multiple times, only to be revived due to the revival ability of Devils.",
